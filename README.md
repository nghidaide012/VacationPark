# VacationPark

OOP project Vacation Parks:
The purpose of the application is to manage and facilitate the rental of various accommodations in the 
vacation parks. 
The various parks and their accommodations must be managed from this system. This means that the 
different parks must be able to be created, modified and deleted. A park can also offer a number of 
additional services, such as a subtropical swimming paradise, bicycle rental, pedal boat rental, bowling 
alleys, children's paradise or a sports hall. Each park must be able to create, adapt and remove 
accommodations. An accommodation can be a hotel room or a bungalow. They have a number of 
general features, such as ID, luxury level (comfort, premium, VIP), the maximum number of people that 
can stay there, surface area, bathroom with shower or bath, ... . Each accommodation itself also has a 
number of unique features. For example, a hotel room is located on a certain floor, it is situated on a 
certain location in the hotel (road side, lake side, ...), it has a number of beds, there is the presence of a 
crib, ..... A bungalow has a number of bedrooms, and depending on the level of luxury, has a Blu-Ray 
player with surround system, a BBQ, bed making service, breakfast service, ... . The level of luxury, and 
therefore the presence of extras, must be adjustable. 
They also want to keep the customers and their bookings in the system. Customers can register 
themselves and book accommodations. A booking consists of a maximum of three accommodations in 
one park. Customers can also change their bookings, but not delete them. In order to do so, they need to 
contact vacation park employees, who can then delete them. When they want to book an 
accommodation, they must be able to enter a number of search terms in order to be able to filter. For 
example, they must be able to enter whether they want to rent a hotel room or bungalow, for how many 
people it is and what level of luxury they want. 
All bookings must be kept in the system with the customer's information, the accommodations that have 
been booked and any additional services of the vacation park (activity pass, sports pass, bike rental, 
swimming pass, ...) that have been booked. 
The owner of the park, the employees as well as the customers must be able to work with the system. The 
owner takes care of the management of the vacation parks (create, modify, delete) and the 
accommodations (create, modify, delete). Employees can also modify accommodations but not create or 
delete them. They can also manage customers (create, modify, delete) and they can do the same with 
bookings. Customers can register themselves in the system and modify but not delete their data. They can 
also book accommodations and modify their bookings. Deleting is only for the employees.
